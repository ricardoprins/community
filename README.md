# Community (yet to be named)

## Community's Code of Conduct:

1. ### Introduction
All members of _COMMUNITY_ are expected to act lawfully, honestly, ethically, and in the best interests of the community while performing duties on its behalf. This code provides some guidelines for conduct required of _COMMUNITY_ Personnel. Persons who are unsure whether their conduct or the conduct of others comply with this code should contact the community managing team. This code applies to all _COMMUNITY_ personnel, including members of the managing team.

2. ### Harassment
_COMMUNITY_ does not tolerate unlawful harassment or any mistreatment by or of any individuals on the basis of sex, race, color, nationality, ethnic or national origin, ancestry, citizenship, religion (or belief, where applicable), age, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, veteran status, marital status, genetic information or characteristics (or those of a family member), or any other category protected under applicable federal, state, or local law. If you suspect harassment, discrimination, or retaliation (as described in our Harassment Policy) has occurred, you are encouraged, and managers are required, to promptly provide a written or oral complaint to a member of the managing team.

3. ### Compliance with laws

All _COMMUNITY_ members are expected to act within the bounds of applicable laws, rules, and regulations of the countries where we do business. The application of these and other laws can be complex and fact-dependent. If you have any questions about the applicability or interpretation of any law, rule, or regulation, you should contact the managing team.

4. ### Reporting Violations

If you learn about or suspect a violation of this code, or any law, you shall promptly report it to a member of the managing team. If you are uncomfortable making such a report, you may do so anonymously if permitted by applicable law.

In cases in which an individual reports a suspected violation of policy or law in good faith and is not engaged in the reported conduct, _COMMUNITY_ will attempt to keep its discussions and actions confidential to the greatest extent possible and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing privacy. _COMMUNITY_ will not retaliate against anyone making a good-faith report of a potential violation, and the report will be appropriately investigated. You must cooperate fully with any investigation, but should not investigate independently, as alleged violations may involve complex legal issues, and you may risk compromising the integrity of a formal investigation.

Conduct that violates the law or community policies is grounds for prompt disciplinary or remedial action. In addition, your failure to report a known violation of law or community policy by someone else may result in disciplinary action and termination of your relationship with _COMMUNITY_. Discipline for a violation of internal policies or applicable law may range from a warning up to and including summary termination of your relationship with _COMMUNITY_ (in accordance with applicable law). _COMMUNITY_â€™s response to reports of possible violations of law may involve disclosure to and cooperation with the appropriate authorities.
